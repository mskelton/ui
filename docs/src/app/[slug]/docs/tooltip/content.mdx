import TooltipDemo from "./TooltipDemo"

## Example

```jsx
import { Button, Tooltip } from "@mskelton/ui"

return (
  <Tooltip content="Edit">
    <Button>✏️</Button>
  </Tooltip>
)
```

<TooltipDemo />

## Features

The `Tooltip` component is built using the CSS
[anchor positioning](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/tether-elements-to-each-other-with-css-anchor-positioning/)
API. This API is still extremely experimental, which is exactly why we are using
it in this library!
